3rd brief for the Web Developper class at Simplon.co

=======================

This is a sample showcase website made using only HTML and CSS made for the sake of exercising the basics of HTML and CSS.

This was made in the context of a brief which explicitly asked me to use only those technologies and especially to get familiar with manipulating HTML elements through CSS.

It helped me consolidate my hability to make a basic HTML infrastructure as well as linking pages together.
And I learned a lot about many CSS properties, discovering their existence and getting used to tune them to get a desired styling.

Any comment on anything you see here, be it the code, the design of the site or anything really is welcome! :D
